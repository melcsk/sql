## "This Cohort"

Welcome to your cohort folder! SQL slides presented in class are found in this folder as well as copies of our in-class code from live-coding sessions.

### Custom Slides

There are two styles of SQL slides, HTML and PDF. Both are generated from R-markdown xarigan files. Below are links to the PDFs:
- [Slides 01](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_01.pdf)

### Live Code

For Modules 2â€”6, [in-class live-code](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/tree/main/04_this_cohort/live_code) is saved to these folders at the conclusion of class*. Please use this code instead of any code shared during class in zoom chats, codeshare, etc.
